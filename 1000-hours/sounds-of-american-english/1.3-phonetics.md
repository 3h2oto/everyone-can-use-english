# 1.3. 音标（Phonetics）

这个教程采用的注音体系是 D.J. 音标。[Daniel Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(phonetician)) 于 1917 年发布 *English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*EPD*, 英语发音词典)，并在其后的多年里反复修订。最终它被剑桥接手，更名为 *Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*CEPD*, 剑桥英语发音词典) 。*CEPD*于 1997 年发布第 *15* 版，增加了一些符号用以同时标注美式发音。目前的 *CEPD* 已经是[第 *18* 版](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/cambridgeenglish/catalog/dictionaries/cambridge-english-pronouncing-dictionary-18th-edition)。D.J. 音标目前被各大英语权威词典广泛采用，除了[剑桥英语发音词典](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/dictionary)之外，还包括 [牛津词典](https://www.oed.com/)、[朗文当代英语词典](https://www.ldoceonline.com/)、[柯林斯 COBUILD](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english)，等等。

The phonetic notation system employed in this tutorial is the D.J. Phonetic transcription, introduced by [Daniel Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(phonetician)) who published his *English Pronouncing Dictionary* (EPD) back in 1917 and continually revised it over many years. Eventually handed over to Cambridge University Press, its name was revamped as the [*Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary*](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/dictionary) (CEPD). The CEPD rolled out its 15^th^ edition sometime around 1997 with an additional set of symbols for American pronunciations tallied along. Now on par with their [18^th^](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/cambridgeenglish/catalog/dictionaries/cambridge-english-pronouncing-dictionary-18th-edition) outing, this sitely respin of Jone's original framework has been widely adopted amongst major authoritative dictionaries - including but not limited to [Oxford](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/dictionary)'s upstanding series or [*Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English*](https://www.ldoceonline.com/) down till [*Collins COBUILD*](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english).

令人遗憾的是，英文的音标并不统一，乃至于各个词典即便是采用同样名称的音标体系 —— IPA（国际音标），或者 D.J. 音标 —— 各自也有一些细微差异，比如，有的用 `əʊ` 有的用 `oʊ`，或者，有的用 `ɒ` 有的用 `ɔ`……

It's unfortunate that the phonetic notation for English is inconsistent. Even dictionaries using the same system, like the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or Daniel Jones' Phonetics, display slight differences. For instance, some use `əʊ` while others use `oʊ`, or some use `ɒ` yet others prefer `ɔ`... It's quite a conundrum.

比较幸运的是，大多数的音标标注差异集中在**元音**标记上，尤其是美式英语的元音 —— 所以也不算是太难掌握。

Luckily, the majority of phonetic notation differences are concentrated in *vowel* markings, especially American vowels, which makes it somewhat easier to master.

关于美式发音的音标标注，可以大致总结为以下几点：

Here are some key points to take note of when it comes to phonetic representation of American English:

> - 短元音 `ʌ` 变得与 `ə` 非常接近，甚至常常直接被 `ə` 替代。比如，*but* `/bʌt/` 可能直接被标注为 `/bət/`。
> - The short vowel `ʌ` often sounds very similar to `ə` and is frequently replaced by it in transcription. For example, *but* `/bʌt/` would be transcribed as `/bət/`.
> - 长短元音不统一使用 `ː` 区分，而是`ə/ɑ`、`ə/ɜ`、`ɚ/ɝ`、 `e/æ`、`ɪ/i`、`ʊ/u`、`ɒ/ɔ`。
> - Long and short vowels are differentiated not by using `ː`, but by pairs such as `ə/ɑ`, `ə/ɜ`, `ɚ/ɝ`, `e/æ`, `ɪ/i`, `ʊ/u`, `ɒ/ɔ`.
> - 短元音 `e` 有时用 `ɛ` 标注。
> - The short vowel `e` is sometimes transcribed as `ɛ`.
> - 短元音 `ə` ，由于经常附带着 `ʳ` 音，常常被标注为 `ɚ`；不带有 `ʳ` 音的时候，常常被标注为 `ɜ`。
> - The short vowel `ə`, often accompanied by the rhotic `ʳ`, is commonly transcribed as `ɚ`. When the rhotic sound is absent, `ə` is often transcribed as `ɜ`.
> - 长元音 `əː`，同样由于经常附带着 `ʳ` 音，常常被标注为 `ɝ`。
> - The long vowel `əː`, due to its frequent association with `ʳ`, is generally transcribed as `ɝ`.
> - `ə` 结尾的双元音，都用 `r`：`ɪə` ⭢ `ɪr`，`eə` ⭢ `er`，`ʊə` ⭢ `ʊr`。
> - Diphthongs ending in `ə` are represented with `r`: `ɪə` becomes `ɪr`, `eə` becomes `er`, `ʊə` becomes `ʊr`.
> - 非重音音节中的 `ɪ` 可能会被标注为 `ə`。
> - The `ɪ` in unstressed syllables may be transcribed as `ə`.
> - 短元音 `ɒ` 在美式发音中读作 `ɑ`，也如此标注，比如，*hot* `/hɑt/` —— `ɑ` 比 `ʌ/ə` 略长一些，比 `ɑr` 短。
> - The short vowel `ɒ` is pronounced as `ɑ` in American English and is transcribed as such. For example, *hot* is transcribed as `/hɑt/`. `ɑ` is slightly longer than `ʌ/ə` but shorter than `ɑr`.
> - `t` 的弹舌音用 `t̬` 标注。
> - The flapping `t` sound in American English is represented by `t̬`.

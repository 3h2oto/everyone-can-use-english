# 2.1. 元音（Vowels）

英文总计 6 个基础元音，分别是 `ʌ`、`e`、`ə`、`ɪ`、`ʊ`、`ɒ` —— 这 6 个短元音就好像是 “根” 一样。剩下的十几个元音要么是它们略有变化的更长版本，即，长元音  ——  `ɑː, æ, əː, iː, uː, ɔː`；要么是它们的组合版本，即，双元音 —— `aɪ, eɪ, ɔɪ, aʊ, oʊ, eə, ɪə, ʊə`。

In English, there are 6 basic vowels: `ʌ`, `e`, `ə`, `ɪ`, `ʊ`, and `ɒ`. Think of these 6 short vowels like the *roots* of a tree. The remaining more than a dozen vowels are either slightly modified, longer versions of these - the *long* vowels, which are `ɑː, æ, əː, iː, uː, ɔː`; or, they are combinations of these basic sounds, known as *diphthongs* - `aɪ, eɪ, ɔɪ, aʊ, oʊ, eə, ɪə, ʊə`.

> 在美式英语中，`eə, ɪə, ʊə` 这 3 个双元音被标注成 `er, ɪr, ʊr`，分别读作 `eər, ɪər, ʊər`。
>
> In American English, the diphthongs `eə, ɪə, ʊə` are noted as `er, ɪr, ʊr`, which are pronounced respectively as `eər, ɪər, ʊər`.

元音的关键在于它们的**长短**。搞错元音的长短，一方面可能会造成错误或者理解困难。更为重要的是另外一方面 —— 会造成**节奏**（[2.5.4](2.5.4-pace)）混乱。

The crux of vowels lies in their *duration*. If you mess up the length of vowels, not only could it lead to errors or difficulties in understanding, but more importantly, it could disrupt the *rhythm* ([2.5.4](2.5.4-pace)).

由于双元音由两个基础元音构成，所以**双元音**的长度与**长元音**相当。于是，英文**音节**的发声总体上倾向于比其它语言更长，因为 20 多个元音中只有 6 个是短的，与之相对的，有两倍以上的数量是长的。这是一个相当显著的差异 —— 尤其在与亚洲语言相比的时候尤为明显，因为在大多数亚洲语言中元音（可能被称为韵母、母音）总是等长的，没有长短之分。

Since diphthongs are composed of two basic vowels, their length is equivalent to that of long vowels. As a result, English syllables tend to be pronounced longer overall than in other languages, given that only 6 out of more than 20 vowels are short, while the remaining, more than double in quantity, are long. This is a rather noticeable difference, especially when compared to Asian languages, where vowels always have equal length, with no distinction between *long* and *short*.

# 2.1.5. `ɪ`/`iː`

这一对元音，不只是长短的区别。

This pair of vowels goes beyond just a difference of length.

`ɪ` 并不是长元音 `iː` 的更短版本，它更像是 `e` 和 `i` 之间的一个音。听起来很像是更短版本的 `eɪ`，从唇形上来看`ɪ` 更接近 `e` 。

The `ɪ` sound doesn't merely represent a shorter version of the long vowel `iː`. Instead, it seems to inhabit a space somewhere between `e` and `i`. It sounds more like a shorter rendition of `eɪ`, and visually speaking, the lip shape for `ɪ` is more akin to `e`.

另外，这个音实际上还有第 3 个版本，`ɪ` 在词汇末尾的时候，更倾向于像是 `iː` 这个长元音的更短版本，`i`，长度介于 `ɪ` 和 `iː` 之间。比如，*responsibility* `/riˌspɑnsəˈbɪləti/`.

In addition, this sound actually has a third variation. When `ɪ` appears at the end of words, it tends to sound more like a shortened version of the long vowel `iː` — `i`, with a length somewhere in between `ɪ` and `iː`. For instance, in the word *responsibility `/riˌspɑnsəˈbɪləti/`.

> Daniel Jones 去世之后，Alfred C. Gimson 接受了他的工作，于 1977 年发布了 D.J. 音标第 14 版。引入 `ɪ ʊ ɒ ɜː` 等符号取代之前使用的 `i u ɔ əː`。1997 年，Peter Roach 再次接手，*English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*EPD*) 更名为 *Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*CEPD*)，并发布 D.J. 音标第 15 版。除了引入能够标注美式发音的 `ɝ, ɚ, t̬` 之外， 还特意修改了词汇末尾的 `ɪ`，将其统一改成了 `i`。也就是说，*happy* 不再被标注为 `/ˈhæpɪ/`，而是 `/ˈhæpi/` 。与此同时，大多数词典所配的真人发音示范，都相应第做了修订。

> After Daniel Jones passed away, Alfred C. Gimson stepped into his shoes and published the 14^th^ edition of the D.J. phonetic symbols in 1977. He introduced symbols like `ɪ ʊ ɒ ɜː`, replacing the previously used `i u ɔ əː`. In 1997, Peter Roach took up the mantle. The *English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*EPD*) was renamed to the *Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary* (*CEPD*) and the 15^th^ edition of D.J. phonetic symbols was released. Not only were symbols `ɝ, ɚ, t̬` introduced to transcribe American pronunciations, but the `ɪ` at the end of words was universally changed to `i`. This means that *happy* is no longer transcribed as `/ˈhæpɪ/`, but as `/ˈhæpi/`. Along with this, most dictionaries also revised their live pronunciation demonstrations to match.

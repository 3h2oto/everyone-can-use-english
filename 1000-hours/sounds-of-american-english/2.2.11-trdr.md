# 3.2.11. `tr/dr`

`tr/dr` 和 `tʃ/dʒ` 不一样的地方在于，虽然发声时起始的舌尖位置相同，但，`tr, dr` 在发声之前嘴唇要有个缩小成圆形的动作，所以它们开头的音节，总是听起来夹带着一个 `w`，*tree* `/triː`/ 听起来是 `/tʃwiː/`，*dry* `/draɪ/` 听起来是 `/dʒwaɪ/`。

The difference between the sounds `tr, dr` and `tʃ, dʒ` lies in the way they are pronounced. Although the initial tongue position is the same for both sets of sounds, with `tr, dr`, there's a slight rounding of the lips before voicing. As a result, the starting syllables often sound as if there's a `w` blended in. So, the word *tree* `/triː/` can sound like `/tʃwiː/`, and *dry* `/draɪ/` can sound like `/dʒwaɪ/`

很多地区的人基于自身母语的习惯，会把 `tr` 和 `dr` 分开着连续读出的。比如，*tree*，印度人可能会把它读成 `/tɤ.riː/`，其中的 `r` 还会用齿龈颤音；再比如，*driver*，可能会被俄罗斯人读成 `/dɤ.raɪvə/` ，其中的 `r` 同样会用齿龈颤音。

People from many regions, guided by the habits of their native languages, may pronounce `tr` and `dr` as separate, continuous sounds. For instance, someone from India might pronounce *tree* as `/tɤ.riː/`, with the `r` articulated as a [*voiced alveolar trill*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental,_alveolar_and_postalveolar_trills). Similarly, the word *driver* might be pronounced as `/dɤ.raɪvə/` by a Russian speaker, again using a voiced alveolar trill for the `r`.

# 3.2.15. `j`, `w`

`j` 和 `w` 是半元音。

The sounds represented by `j` and `w` are semivowels in English.

`j` 与后面的元音相连，相当于在那个元音前面加上了一个 `ɪ`，比如 *you* `/juː/`，读音上相当于是 `/iuː/`。

When `j` is connected to the following vowel, it is as if an `ɪ` sound is added in front of that vowel. For instance, the word *you* `/juː/`, pronounced the same as `/ɪuː/`.

`w` 与后面的元音相连，相当于在那个元音前面加上了一个 `ʊ`，比如 *way* `juː`，读音上相当于是 `ʊeɪ`。

Similarly, when `w` is paired with a vowel, it's as if a `ʊ` sound precedes that vowel. Take the word *way* `/weɪ/`, pronounced the same as `/ʊeɪ/`.

`w` 可以和另外的辅音结合作为音节开头：`sw`、`tw`、`dw`、`kw`、`skw`、`gw`…… 这其中最容易出错也最常的是 `kw`，尤其是 `kwɒ` 和 `kwɔː`，比如，*quart* `/kwɔːt/`，常常会被误读为 `/kɔːt/`（听起来和 *court* 同音）；再比如，*quality* `/ˈkwɔːlɪti/`常常会被误读为 `/ˈkɔːlɪti/` —— 关键在于，`k` 的音之后有一个发出 `ʊ` 的嘴唇动作，否则 `kw` 就变成了 `k` —— 这个差异在母语使用者听起来异常地明显。

The letter `w` can combine with other consonants to form the beginning of a syllable, such as `sw`, `tw`, `dw`, `kw`, `skw`, `gw`… The most common and often mispronounced combination is `kw`, specifically `kwɒ` and `kwɔː`. For example, the word *quart* is pronounced `/kwɔːt/`, but it is often misconstrued as `/kɔːt/`, which sounds like *court*, or *quality* `/ˈkwɔːlɪti/` as `/ˈkɔːlɪti/`. The key to getting this right is to make a lip movement for the `ʊ` sound after the `k` sound; otherwise, `kw` just becomes `k`. This distinction is incredibly noticeable to native speakers.

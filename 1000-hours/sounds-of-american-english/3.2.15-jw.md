# 3.2.15. `j`, `w`

`j` 和 `w` 是半元音。

The sounds represented by `j` and `w` are semivowels in English.

`j` 与后面的元音相连，相当于在那个元音前面加上了一个 `ɪ`，比如 *you* `/juː/`，读音上相当于是 `/iuː/`。

When `j` is connected to the following vowel, it is as if an `ɪ` sound is added in front of that vowel. For instance, the word *you* `/juː/`, pronounced the same as `/ɪuː/`.

`w` 与后面的元音相连，相当于在那个元音前面加上了一个 `ʊ`，比如 *way* `juː`，读音上相当于是 `ʊeɪ`。

Similarly, when `w` is paired with a vowel, it's as if a `ʊ` sound precedes that vowel. Take the word *way* `/weɪ/`, pronounced the same as `/ʊeɪ/`.
